# Memory - Platform Build Context

## Project Identity
- **Product Name**: SayfeAI Sales Hunter
- **Repo**: `csbenson001/sayfeai-saleshunter` (private)
- **Upstream Base**: `cgoinglove/better-chatbot` (public)
- **Business Model**: Results-as-a-Service (RaaS)
- **Beachhead Vertical**: Sales Hunter (chemical distribution + oil & gas regulatory)
- **Target Market**: Mid-tier companies, $10M ARR goal
- **Main Branch**: `main` (merged from `claude/platform-architecture-planning-h1crR`)

## Stack
- **Next.js 16.1.6** + React 19.2.4 + TypeScript 5.9
- **PostgreSQL** with Drizzle ORM + pgvector
- **Vercel AI SDK** - Multi-provider AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, XAI, Ollama, OpenRouter)
- **better-auth** for authentication
- **Redis** for multi-instance support
- **Pre-commit**: lint-staged with prettier + eslint

## Key Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Monolith** - NOT microservices. Verticals are isolated modules.
- **Single schema file** - All tables in `src/lib/db/pg/schema.pg.ts`
- **Multi-tenancy** - `tenant_id` on all platform tables. Default: `"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"`
- **Agentic Configuration** - Agents configured via database/JSON, not code changes
- **Two naming conventions** in schema: upstream uses `*Table`, platform uses `*Schema`

## Build History (5 Sessions)

### Session 1: Platform Foundation
- Architecture strategy doc
- Sales Hunter vertical (5 AI agents, workflows, prompts, metrics)
- Salesforce connector (OAuth, sync, mappings)
- Admin dashboard (billing, usage, tenants, users, activity)
- Billing tables and plans
- Platform types (559 lines)

### Session 2: Core Modules (7 parallel agents)
- RBAC (roles, permissions, API keys, trials)
- Knowledge Base (ingestion, chunking, embeddings, search)
- Company Intelligence (research engine, products, value chains)
- Industry Context (seed data for 15 regulatory programs)
- Prospecting (EPA ECHO scanner, web scanner, prospect scorer)
- Contact Intelligence (enrichment, scoring, filing extraction)
- State Research (orchestrator, sources registry, agent configs)

### Session 3: Completion + Polish
- Fixed ~50 TypeScript errors
- Added prospecting and industry modules (API routes + UI pages)
- Built missing pages (filings, contacts, research, company, industries)
- Added navigation links throughout

### Session 4: Sales Intelligence (10 Modules)
- Sales Brief Generator
- Real-Time Alert System
- Autonomous Research Workflows
- Relationship Mapping & Buying Committee
- Vertical Sales Playbooks & Battle Cards
- Buying Signal Detection
- Compliance Burden Calculator (15 regulatory programs)
- Outreach Sequence Generator
- Customer Health & Expansion Scoring
- Win/Loss Analysis Engine
- 46 files, 10,029 insertions

### Session 5: Merge + Transition
- Merged upstream main (Next.js 16.1.6 upgrade)
- Resolved conflicts (schema, repository, gitignore)
- Fixed UserSchema -> UserTable references (12 FK refs)
- Removed unused React imports
- Created private repo `sayfeai-saleshunter`
- Created CLAUDE.md and transition docs

## Current Stats
- **202 platform files**, **42,551 lines** of platform code
- **0 TypeScript errors** in platform code
- **572 tests passing**
- **98 upstream dependency TS errors** (suppressed by skipLibCheck)

## What Needs Doing Next (Prioritized)

### P0: Make It Run ✅
1. ~~Generate Drizzle migrations for platform tables~~
2. ~~Set up PostgreSQL with pgvector extension~~
3. ~~Run migrations against a real database~~
4. ~~Fix upstream TypeScript errors~~
5. ~~Get `pnpm dev` running end-to-end~~

### P1: Make It Work ✅
6. ~~Wire up environment variables (.env configuration)~~
7. Test Salesforce connector against sandbox
8. ~~Add authentication guards to platform API routes~~
9. ~~Write integration tests for core flows~~
10. ~~Connect AI modules to actual LLM calls~~

### P2: Make It Ship
11. Wire up Clerk/Stripe billing integration
12. Add real-time WebSocket updates for alerts and workflow runs
13. Build onboarding flow for new tenants
14. Performance optimization (server components, caching)
15. Deploy to Vercel or Docker

## Salesforce Connector
- Uses Salesforce REST API (jsforce-compatible patterns)
- OAuth 2.0 flow for authentication
- SOQL for data queries
- Supports: Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities, Tasks, Custom Objects

## Sales Hunter AI Agents
- **Prospector**: Finds and qualifies prospects from regulatory data
- **Qualifier**: Scores leads based on compliance burden and buying signals
- **Outreach Composer**: Generates personalized multi-channel sequences
- **Pipeline Analyst**: Analyzes deal velocity and conversion patterns
- **Deal Coach**: Real-time coaching during deal progression

## Billing Plans
- Starter ($2K/mo), Professional ($5K/mo), Enterprise ($10K+/mo)
- Usage-based billing via usage tracking tables
- Clerk handles payment processing and subscription management
